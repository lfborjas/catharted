catharted info: just say it
=================

An experiment on node.js and minimalistic programming (trying to use only the necessary things client-side, and maybe even server side). 

Just write a 280 character rant and it will go away after a while. Full anonymity. Have some fun with the rants of other people. 

I kinda let this die, if you like it, fork it!

Dependencies for production
---------------------------
* expressjs (`npm install expressjs`) : the development framework
* hamljs (`npm install hamljs`) : for template rendering. Supposedly faster than haml-js
* ext (`npm install ext`) : various utilities for javascript

Dependencies for development
----------------------------
* sass (`gem install haml`)

Rules
-----

No links. No duplicate rants. No spam (don't even bother, it will disappear, anyway)

About the project
-----------------

Created in a insomniac night. If you like the idea, feel free to fork it and send me a pull request with changes or bug fixes, the philosophy is simple: minimalistic design and programming, no ads, anonymity.
